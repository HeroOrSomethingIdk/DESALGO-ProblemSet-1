'''
Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element A[0].
Then find the second smallest element of A and exchange it with A[1]. Continue in this manner for the first n = 1 elements of A.

a.) The algorithm described is known as selection sort. 
b.) Use a loop invariant to check that the algorithm is correct, and make sure that the loop invariant fulfills the 3 necessary properties.
